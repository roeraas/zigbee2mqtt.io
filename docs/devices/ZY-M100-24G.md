## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_lux_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance_lux value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### State (enum)
Presence state.
Value can be found in the published state on the `state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `none`, `presence`, `move`.

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Distance (numeric)
Target distance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `distance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Illuminance (lux) (numeric)
Measured illuminance in lux.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance_lux` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Motion sensitivity (numeric)
Motion sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `motion_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"motion_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `10`.

### Occupancy sensitivity (numeric)
Occupancy sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupancy_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `10`.

### Max range (numeric)
Maximum range.
Value can be found in the published state on the `max_range` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"max_range": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1.5` and the maximum value is `5.5`.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Occupancy timeout (numeric)
Occupancy timeout.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy_timeout` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupancy_timeout": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `1500`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
